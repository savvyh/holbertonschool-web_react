## Tasks

### 1.

Create and run Webpack using a basic installation.

*   Create a folder named `task_0`.
*   Install `webpack` and `webpack-cli` as developer dependencies within the folder using `npm`.
*   Install `jQuery` as a regular dependency using `npm`.
*   Make sure that `webpack` and `webpack-cli` are listed under the devDependencies key along with `jQuery` being listed under the dependencies key within the package.json
*   Create a `src` directory with a `index.js` in it.
*   The file should import `jquery` and add three different paragraphs to the page body: (refer to this [link](/rltoken/XJSRYhglsAljFvprI-PcDQ "link") under the Babel section for importing jQuery)
```
Holberton Dashboard

Dashboard data for the students

Copyright - Holberton School
```
*   Create a `dist/index.html`. Import your `main.js` in the body.
*   You must use `jQuery` to add the elements to the body of the page.
*   When running `Webpack`, your `javascript` and `html` files should be generated in a `dist` folder.
*   You should not use a custom `webpack` config file.
*   Opening your main file should not generate any error in the console.
*   Your `html` code should only import one `Javascript` script (the one generated by `webpack`).
*   Do NOT push your `dist/main.js` if you have one.

  

### 2.

**Installing packages**

*   Create a folder named `task_1`, `cd` into it, and create a package.json using `npm init -y`
*   Install webpack (dev dependency), jQuery (dependency), and Lodash (dependency) within the folder using `npm`.
*   Modify your `package.json` to add a `build` script that runs `webpack` to create build output. This lets you execute `npm run build` on the command line.

**Using jQuery**

*   Create a `js` directory with a javascript file named `dashboard_main.js` in it. The file should import `jquery` and add the below elements in the following order:
    *   Paragraph element: `Holberton Dashboard`
    *   Paragraph element: `Dashboard data for the students`
    *   Button element with the text `Click here to get started`
    *   Add a paragraph element as so `<p id='count'></p>`
    *   Add another paragraph: `Copyright - Holberton School`

**Prevent spammers**

*   Write a function called `updateCounter()` that tracks the number of times the button element has been clicked.
*   Each time it’s called, update the count by 1 and set the content of the paragraph element with id=‘count’ to `{count} clicks on the button`
*   Bind the debounce function in Lodash to the click event on the button you created previously (The number of milliseconds to delay invocation should be 500).

**Requirements:**

*   When running Webpack, your javascript should be generated in a `public` folder. You should also place your index.html in this folder.
*   The javascript file generated by Webpack should be named `bundle.js`
*   Set Webpack config mode to production
*   Opening your html file should not generate any error in the console
*   Your html code should only import one Javascript script (the one generated by webpack)

**Resources:**

*   [Debounce documentation on Lodash](/rltoken/7QYXiG5Yp93dN0WWCPMpVA " Debounce documentation on Lodash ")

  

### 3.

**Install these** `devDependencies`:

*   css-loader
*   file-loader
*   image-webpack-loader
*   style-loader

Create a specific configuration for Webpack.

*   Using the folder named `task_2`.
*   Reuse the code from `task_1`.
*   Modify the webpack config to support adding CSS to the bundle.
*   Modify the webpack config to support adding images to the CSS.
*   Create a folder named `css`
*   In a file named `main.css`, change the position of the counter text to be displayed on the right of the button and in bold.
*   Add an element at the top of document with the id `#logo` which has a width of 200px and height of 200px.
*   Set the background of the element with the image in `task_2/assets/holberton-logo.jpg`. (use `background-image`)
*   Set the width and height of the logo background image to 200px by 200px.
*   Make sure to configure Webpack to optimize images.
*   When running Webpack, your javascript and html files should be generated in a `public` folder.
*   The javascript file generated by Webpack should be named `bundle.js`.
*   Set Webpack config mode to production.
*   Opening your main file should not generate any error in the console.
*   Your html code should only import one Javascript script (the one generated by webpack).
*   When running Webpack, you should not see the warning `WARNING in asset size limit: The following asset(s) exceed the recommended size limit`

  

### 4.

**Install these** `devDependencies`:

*   clean-webpack-plugin
*   html-webpack-plugin
*   webpack-dev-server

Using the folder named `task_3`. **Set up a development server:**

*   Reuse the code from `task_2`.
*   Modify the Webpack config to setup a development server running on the port 8564.
*   Modify the Webpack config to set its `mode` to `development`.
*   Add a script in the `package.json` to start the server and open the browser with `npm run start-dev`.

**Divide the code into modules:**

*   Divide the main bundle into three modules.
*   `header` should contain a `header.css` and `header.js` files.
*   Import jQuery, and add the logo and the H1 title to the `header.js` file (with content `Holberton Dashboard`). Add a console.log printing `Init header`.
*   Add the needed style to the `header.css` file.
*   `body` should contain a `body.css` and `body.js` files.
*   Import jQuery, Lodash and add the body code (button, counter) in the `body.js` file.
*   Add the needed style to the `body.css` file.
*   `footer` should contain a `footer.css` and `footer.js` files.
*   Import jQuery, and append a paragraph the copyright text `Copyright - Holberton School`.
*   Add the needed style to the `footer.css` file.
*   Modify the Webpack configuration to support three different entry points (`header`, `body`, `footer`). Each entry point should generate a filename with the following format `name_of_the_file.bundle.js`.
*   Do NOT have a `task_3/public/` directory pushed to your repository.
*   Add a plugin to Webpack to automatically create an `index.html` HTML file

**Improve development speed**

*   Modify the webpack config to support inline source mapping.
*   Check that the console.log in the header.js now takes you to your javascript file instead of the main bundle.
*   Add a plugin to Webpack to clean your build folder on each build.

**Improve bundles size:**

*   You can see that the current modules generated with `npm run build` are quite large. They all contain jQuery and/or Lodash. Modify the Webpack configuration to split the modules in chunks.

**Requirements:**

*   When running the dev server, your code should work on `http://localhost:8564/`.
*   When running Webpack, your javascript and html files should be generated in a `public` folder.
*   Opening your main file should not generate any error in the console.
