## Tasks

### 1.

Using the previous project (`React inline styling`), we have modularized our React application without worrying about interactions and state, which is usually a recommended approach to development. Now, our application is in a good position to start adding logic and state.

**Modify the App component in `task_0/dashboard/src/App/App.jsx`:**

Create a local state to store a `displayDrawer` element:

*   Define the default value for the state in the `constructor` of the Class
*   Create a function named `handleDisplayDrawer` that will set the value of `displayDrawer` to `true`
*   Create a function named `handleHideDrawer` that will set the value of `displayDrawer` to `false`

  

**Modify the `Notifications` import in `App.jsx`:**

*   Pass the `displayDrawer` prop to the component using the local state
*   Pass the new functions `handleDisplayDrawer` and `handleHideDrawer` as props.

  

**Modify the Notifications component in `Notifications.jsx`:**

*   When clicking on `Your notifications`, call `handleDisplayDrawer`
*   When clicking on the close button, call `handleHideDrawer`

At this point, after reloading the React application you should be able to show or hide the notifications panel

  

**Modify the Notifications test suite in `Notifications.spec.js`:**

*   Add a test to verify that clicking on the menu item calls `handleDisplayDrawer`
*   Add a test to verify that clicking on the close button calls `handleHideDrawer`

  

**Tips:**

*   Remember that you implemented `shouldComponentUpdate`. You will need to modify its logic to allow the component to re-render when the `displayDrawer` prop changes
*   Remember to use spies to verify whether a function is being called. You can pass a spy as a property

  

**Requirements:**

*   When running the application, there should not be any errors in the console

  

### 2.

**Create a form within the Login component & handle login submission in `task_1/dashboard/src/Login/Login.jsx`:**

To solve this task, convert you should the functional `Login` component to a `class` component:

*   Create a local state with the value `isLoggedIn` set to `false`
*   Create a function named `handleLoginSubmit` that updates the local state by setting `isLoggedIn` to `true`
*   Wrap the input fields within a `form` element
*   Replace the button with an `input` element of type `submit`
*   When the form is submitted, call the newly created login submission handling function

  

**Create controlled component:**

*   Modify the local state to add two new values: `email` and `password`. By default, both should be empty strings.
*   Set the email and the password input values to the local state
*   Create two methods, `handleChangeEmail` and `handleChangePassword`:
    *   Each method should handle changes to its respective input field (Email or Password):
        *   When the user types into the email input, `handleChangeEmail` should be called
        *   When the user types into the password input, `handleChangePassword` should be called
*   Ensure the local component state updates in real time as the user types:
    *   The email input field should update the email state
    *   The password input field should update the password state accordingly.

  

**Modify state callback:**

*   Modify the local state to add a new value `enableSubmit`, set to `false` by default.
*   Modify the Submit button so that it is only enabled when the `enableSubmit` value is `true`
*   Enable the Submit button whenever:
    *   Both fields are not empty.
    *   The email input contains a valid email address.
    *   The password input contains at least 8 characters.

  

**Add tests:**

*   Add a test to verify that the submit button is disabled by default.
*   Add a test to verify that the button becomes enabled only after both the Email and Password inputs meet the required criteria.

  

**Requirements:**

*   The state should have all the default values set in the `constructor`
*   Submitting the form should not reload the page.
*   The `email` input must be valid email address, and the `password` must have at least 8 characters.
*   The submit input should be enabled when the above conditions are met
*   There should not be any linting errors in the console when running the application.

  

**Tips:**

*   Use a regular expression (Regex) to validate the email input.
*   At this stage, clicking the enabled Submit input does not render the CourseList component. This functionality will be addressed in the next task.

  

### 3.

**Create a simple React Context in `task_2/dashboard/src/Context/context.js`:**

*   Define a default user object with the following properties:
    
    *   `email`: set to an empty string
    *   `password`: set to an empty string
    *   `isLoggedIn`: set to false
*   Define a default `logOut` function as an empty function
    

Create and export (**with export default only**) a `newContext` variable that initializes a new React context. This context should include the user object and the logOut function as its default values.

  

**Create the local state for the App in `App.jsx`:**

*   Update the local state of the `App` component by:
    
    *   Adding a user object that mirrors the context’s user object
    *   Adding a logout property that references the logOut function from the context
*   Create a `logIn` method that takes `email` and `password` as parameters. When the method is called:
    
    *   Update the user object in the local state
    *   Set the `email` and `password` to the values entered.
    *   Set the `isLoggedIn` value to `true`
*   Create a `logOut` method that resets the value of the `user` object in the local state
    
*   Remove the `isLoggedIn` and `logOut` props from the `App`. These will now be accessed through the state.
    
*   In the `render()` method, refactor the code to use the state to display either the `CourseList` or the `Login` components.
    
*   Pass the new `logIn` method,along with the user’s email and password, to the `Login` component as props.
    

  

**in `Login.jsx`:**

*   Update the local state:
    *   Remove the `isLoggedIn` property, as it is no longer used.
    *   Retrieve email and password from the props object (ensure they have default values).
*   Modify the `handleLoginSubmit` to call the newly created `logIn` method from the props.

  

**Checkpoint**

Test your application. At this point, you should be able to log in to your React app:

*   By entering a valid email and a password with 8 or more characters:
    
    *   The submit button should become clickable. -The `CourseList` component should render.
    *   The `Login` component should unmount.
*   Verify that the Notifications panel continues to work correctly. You should be able to show/hide the panel by clicking the top-right text and the close button.
    

  

**Setting the context in `App.jsx`:**

*   In the App component, wrap the entire app with the context provider element created earlier.
*   Set the value of the provider to the context’s user object and logOut function using the local state.

  

**Add tests on the `Login.spec.js`:**

*   Verify that the logIn method prop is correctly called with the user’s email and password when the login form is submitted

  

**Tip:**

*   As we’re carrying forward tests from task_1, note that the App component’s architecture changed in task_2\. It no longer accepts `isLoggedIn` as a prop - it uses Context-based state instead. You may need to adjust related tests accordingly

  

**Requirements:**

*   Be aware that React Context uses reference identity to determine when to re-render. Avoid directly creating objects within the provider’s value prop.
*   The submit button should only be enabled if the email is valid and the password is at least 8 characters long.

  

### 4.

**Modify the `Header` component in `task_3/dashboard/src/Header/Header.jsx`:**

*   Use the `ContextType` API to allow the `Header` component to inherit the context.
*   Add a new section under the header that is only displayed when the `isLoggedIn` property in the `user` object within the context is `true`:
    *   This section should display “Welcome **email** (_logout_)”
    *   Add the id attribute `logoutSection` to this section.
    *   When clicking on the `logout` link, should call the `logOut` function from the context.

  

At this point, your Holberton Dashboard React application should allow users to log in and log out successfully.

  

**Create the tests!In `Header.spec.js`**

*   Ensure all current tests pass without errors.
*   When the `Header` component uses a default context value, verify that the `logoutSection` is not rendered.
*   When the `Header` component is provided with a user context where `isLoggedIn` is `true`, and email and password are set, verify that the`logoutSection` is rendered.
*   When the `Header` component is provided with a user context where `isLoggedIn` is `true`, and email and password are set, link the `logOut` function to a spy. Verify that clicking on the “logout” link calls the spy.

  

**In `App.spec.js`**

*   Refactor the previous tests to rely on the application’s state instead of props.
*   Refactor the tests to verify that the user interface updates correctly whenever the state changes.

  

**Requirements:**

*   Your React application should fully support both login and logout functionality.
*   The logout functionality must be triggered from the Header component.
*   After refactoring, ensure that any unused state and props are cleaned up.

  

### 5.

**Context consumer: modify the Footer component in `task_4/dashboard/src/Footer/Footer.jsx`**

*   Without converting the component into a class, subscribe the Footer component to context changes.
*   When a user exists and is logged in, display a new paragraph containing a link with the text: `Contact us`.

  

**Modify the test suite in `Footer.spec.js`:**

*   Refactor the tests to work correctly with the updated `Footer` component.
*   Add a test to verify that the “Contact us” link is not displayed when the user is logged out in the context.
*   Add a test to verify that the “Contact us” link is displayed when the user is logged in within the context.

  

**Advanced state: Modify the `App` container in `App.jsx`:**

Update the state of the `App` component to include two properties:

*   notifications: Holds the values from `notificationsList`.
*   courses: Holds the values from `coursesList`.
*   Create a method `markNotificationAsRead`:
    
    *   It accepts an `id` (number) as a parameter
    *   Logs the string: `Notification {id} has been marked as read` to the console.
    *   Removes the notification with the given id from the notifications list within the state.

  

Pass the new method as a prop to the `Notifications` component.

Pass the list of notifications to the `Notifications` component using the state.

  

**Modify the `Notifications` container in `Notifications.jsx`:**

*   Replace the `shouldComponentUpdate` method by converting the component to a `PureComponent`. This will enable automatic comparison of props and state.
*   Replace the existing `markAsRead` method with the new `markNotificationAsRead` method received as a prop.

  

**Modify the test suite in `App.spec.js`:**

*   Add a test to verify that:
    
    *   Clicking on a notification item removes it from the notification list.
    *   Logs the expected string with the corresponding notification ID to the console.

  

**Modify the test suite in `Notifications.spec.js`:**

*   Refactor the tests to match the updated structure of the `Notifications` component.

  

**Checkpoint**

Test your application to ensure the following functionality:

*   When logged in:
    
    *   A new paragraph with a “Contact us” link should appear in the `Footer`.
*   When viewing the notification panel:
    
    *   Clicking on any notification item should remove it and log the corresponding string to the console.

  

**Requirements:**

*   By clicking on any notification item, you should be able to remove it from the notification list and log the appropriate string with the corresponding notification ID to the console.
*   The`markNotificationAsRead` method should handle both the removal and the logging.
*   A valid email address and 8+ character password are required to activate the submit button.
*   A logged in user should see a `logout` link in the `Header` component and a `Contact us` link in the `Footer` component
*   No console errors should be raised
*   No linting errors
